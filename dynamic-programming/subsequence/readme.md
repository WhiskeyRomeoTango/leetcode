# Subsequence

**Subsequence** problems can usually be solved efficiently by DP. Note that it's **sequence**, suggesting that there is a specific order in the parent array structures we would need to isolate, and the resulting subsequence we identified doesn't need to be contiguous from the parents. Also, these problems typically ask us to find the subsequence with maximum length. If the goal is to find all subsequences that follow a particular rule, then backtracking is probably more suited. (Maybe ???)
